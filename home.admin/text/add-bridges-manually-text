With this menu entry, you can ADD BRIDGES MANUALLY. Bridges are necessary for Tor to bypass Tor blocking in a country.

With the help of this dialogue-based configuration assistant, 3-5 bridges can easily be added. When adding more than five bridges, it is recommended to edit the torrc.

HOW TO OBTAIN BRIDGES?
With Tor, you have three ways to obtain bridges:
1. Obtain about every 24h one bridge automatically.
2. Get them here: https://bridges.torproject.org/
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges).
3. Send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address from Riseup
   or Gmail with "get transport obfs4" in the body of the mail.
