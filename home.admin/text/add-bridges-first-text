Currently, no bridges are configured. Bridges are necessary for Tor to bypass Tor blocking in a country. With the help of this dialog-based configuration assistant, bridges can easily be added. When adding more than 5 bridges, it is recommended to edit the torrc.

HOW TO OBTAIN BRIDGES?
With Tor, you have three ways to obtain bridges:
1. Obtain about every 24h one bridge automatically.
2. Get them here: https://bridges.torproject.org/
   (chose "Advanced Options", "obfs4" and press "Get Bridges).
3. Send an email to bridges@torproject.org, using an address from Riseup
   or Gmail with "get transport obfs4" in the body of the mail.

Would you like to start adding bridges, now?
