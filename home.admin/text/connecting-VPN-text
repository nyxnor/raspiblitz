This menu entry will connect the Tor to a VPN so that the local
network data from the command prompt is routed through VPN. However,
this menu entry will not restart Tor, and your client network data will
still be routed through Tor using the interface highlighted in the main
menu.

IMPORTANT
- To use this menu entry, you have first to put one ore more *.ovpn
  - files in the ~/openvpn directory so that Tor can execute OpenVPN
  with that file.
- We do NOT recommend using a VPN. If Tor entry guards cannot be reached
  for censorship reasons, we recommend using OBFS4 bridges as a priority.
  We consider a VPN connection as a last resort.
- Nevertheless, we consider the additional risk of this "Tor over VPN"
  situation to be proportionate - see here: https://bit.ly/31lUhLQ
