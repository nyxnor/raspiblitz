This menu entry supposes that Tor is connected with the internet
through a VPN connection using the interface tun0. There are two
possibilities of how Tor on Raspiblitz handles VPN connections:

1. The VPN connection is already established, and the interface tun0 is
   configured.

2. The VPN connection is not established yet, but one ore more *.ovpn
   - files are in the ~/openvpn directory so that Tor can execute
   OpenVPN with that file.

IMPORTANT
- We do NOT recommend using a VPN. If Tor entry guards cannot be reached
  for censorship reasons, we recommend using OBFS4 bridges as a priority.
  We consider a VPN connection as a last resort.
- Nevertheless, we consider the additional risk of this "Tor over VPN"
  situation  to be proportionate - see here: https://bit.ly/31lUhLQ
